# Dual License Templates

Various commercial license templates for open source projects that want to use the sustainable dual-license model.

## How does the dual license model work?

With dual licensing, developers can distribute software using both an open source license and a commercial license. This allows the developer to have the advantages of both types of licenses.

The open source license allows the developer to share the source code with the community, usually for teaching purposes or to allow contributions. Typically, the open source license chosen is a copyleft or "viral" license, such as the GPLv3 or Affero GPL. Licenses like these allow licensees to use the software for commercial purposes, but require that the new software and any changes to the original code are also open-sourced under the same license. The same-license requirement creates a problem for companies that need to keep the rest of their source code proprietary to maintain a competetive advantage.

This is where the dual-license model comes in. Rather than only choosing a copyleft license and making your code unfit for most commercial use, you can offer to sell commercial licenses that don't have the same terms as the open source license. This allows the company that wants to use your code to develop their own software without worrying about license infringement or maintaining competetive advantage. Additionally, open source projects and ecosystems are typically difficult to sustain because of the lack of funding. The money that you gain from selling the commercial license can help fund further development of the project.
